# ID-Assignment02 - PokeDex
The Pokedex webpage is a web application of a PokeDex or Pokemon encyclopedia consisting of Pokemons in the Japanese role play game franchaise from the first generation up to the fifth generation. Goal being to allow users to search up and view detailed information of a specific Pokemon.

## Design Process
While the franchaise of the Pokemon games on the Nintendo handhelds have their own Pokedex in the game the information given is often not enough for players to leverage towards a more competitive gameplay. Hence the PokeDex webpage/web application was designed to give in depth details of a single pokemon giving the users; *this is mainly targeted towards competitive players.* The look and feel of the design are aligned with the theme of the game itself.
