# ID-Assignment02 - PokeDex
The Pokedex webpage is a web application of a PokeDex or Pokemon encyclopedia consisting of Pokemons in the Japanese role play game franchaise from the first generation up to the fifth generation. Goal being to allow users to search up and view detailed information of a specific Pokemon.

## Design Process
While the franchaise of the Pokemon games on the Nintendo handhelds have their own Pokedex in the game the information given is often not enough for players to leverage towards a more competitive gameplay. Hence the PokeDex webpage/web application was designed to give in depth details of a single pokemon giving the users; *this is mainly targeted towards competitive players.* The look and feel of the design are aligned with the theme of the game itself.

## Technologies Used & Additional Features Created
### APIs
PokeAPI was used to retrieve using fetch to display the most relevant information needed for the Pokemons.
### Header
Due to the length of the page users may find themselves scrolling often, a fixed header will allow easy navigation at all times regardless of where the
user is on the page.
### Modal Box
"Details" button opens up the details of a particular Pokemon to display the stats. Using a modal box allows this this application to run on a single page.
This feature was creating using JavaScript and CSS. 
### Javascript - Back to top button
Due to the length of the page users may find themselves scrolling often, this button was added to help with the user's navigation through the page. This button works similarly to the "Home" link/button in the header.
### Javascript - Autocomplete/Suggestions Search Box
Users may not remember or get a Pokemon name spelling correct on the first try, this feature is implemented to assist the user in searching for a Pokemon better improving the experience. Along with the suggestions, "Enter" or return key has been binded to the "Search" button of the search bar which helps give an intuitive user experience.
